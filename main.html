		<h1> <a href="rust.html">#1 Rust</a> </h1> 
		
		<p> My #1 favorite game has to be Rust. Rust is an open world game that allows you to build a base, get loot around the map, and raid other people bases. You can play with friends or by yourself, in an online pvp game. To explain, I have spent a long time playing this game and have seen it get better with every update. I started playing roughly when the barns started coming which isnt that long compared to others, however I know alot about the game. I have 2,354 hours currently on the game as of 5/4/2022 and can play this game for hours and even days on end. There is alot that you can do and many different servers that you can choose from that can be very different from others. With ever new update bringing more content to have fun. </p>
		<h2> <a href="phasmophobia.html">#2 Phasmophobia</a> </h2>
		
		<p> Number 2 is going to be Phasmophobia. Phasmophobia actually means the fear of ghosts. Phasmophobia is a ghost hunting horror game that you can play by yourself or with 3 other people. You are put in a map with equipment needed to find the ghost and determain the type of ghost it is. There are currently 21 different ghost types with all different abilities. some being super strong being able to hunt early such as a demon, a ghost that is able to move way faster than the player like a Revenent or a Raiju, and some that are weaker such as the shade that doesnt like to interact with the enviornment very often. The game is extremely fun with one of the best developement team i have ever seen constantly pushing out updates and bug fixes to make the game better that is still in its early access version. <p>
		<h2> <a href="minecraft.html">#3 Minecraft</a></h2>
		
		<p> Number 3 is a classic game known by many people all over the world. Minecraft! Good old minecraft being out for 11 years now. Minecraft is a open world sandbox game that allows you to do whatever you want online or by yourself. if you want to build a castle there is nothing stopping you, if you want to make a farm, then go for it! Minecraft is a very fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. </p>
		<h2> <a href="ark.html">#4 Ark</a> </h2>
		
		<p> Number 4 and the last one on this list is ark survival evolved. Ark is like minecraft and rust however with the addition to dinosaurs that yo are able to tame, ride, and breed. This game is roughly 7 years old and has many DLC's that add alot of brand new content. They are also releasing Ark 2 sometime in the near future and possibly the end of this year! </p>
