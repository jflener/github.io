		<h1> My Favorite </h1>
		<p> Rust is hands down my favorite video game because it has alot of content for me to play with, as well as having thousands of different servers that i can choose from that are mostly unique. I can spend a week making a huge farm, or have the most rockets or something and the best part is that you can do whatever you want and as long as you arent cheating its ok. Facepunch the creators of rust do not care about the in game player made content, this means that is someone wanted to build something morally wrong then they can and they cant get in trouble for it. </p>
