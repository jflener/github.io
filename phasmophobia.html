	<h1> Number 2 </h1>
	
	<p> Phasmophobia is my second favorite game mainy because the game is easy to understanda and very fun to play. I play alot even though I am a low-level player, i still have enough game knowledge to understand all the ghosts and their special abilities as well as many glitches that have and are still in the game. The game somewhat new compared to others that are on this list. The developement of this game is like no other with constant updates, and more content being added makes this game alot of fun to play. From when i first stared to play this game to now, it feels like almost a completely different game.</p>
